# Week Five Notes

## Sonification

- used their sample data, Honey production in the USA (1998-2012) to familiarize myself with the program
- different tones stand out more when you listen to them than others
- when using the archaeological data, the program still displays the qualitative data (where the materials were found) on the bottom so that people can 
- lowered the volume of the count of other Roman materials because I wanted to notice when coins were found
  - I set it to 90% volume while the other stayed at 100%
  - also set the instrument for count of other Roman materials to piano and count of coins to trumpet
  - different intruments, volume settings, and sounds could change what the listener hears, thus changing the meaning of the song
- The duration of the song co-incides with the place where the materials were found
  - could help us see patterns in the change of the number of coins as it gets further along in the song
  
What tones, sounds, settings make sense given your data? How do different choices affect the meaning of what youâ€™ve created? Is there anything meaningful? Save your music and your notes/thoughts on making it, to your repository.

## Mapping
- didn't have any location-based research in mind at first, so I just mapped a theoretical road trip I would have from my hometown to Ottawa

- map is in the style of the maps from the time period
- shows the movement of the battles, who was attacking from where, how they had to transport troops/resources

- web maps
- tried adding more data https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/web_development/9781783554812/1/ch01lvl1sec12/adding-data-to-your-map#:~:text=You%20can%20create%20a%20marker,interact%20with%20it%20by%20name but the instructions didn't work
- adding animation
- error

## Posters
- academic posters and infographics
- information visualization: mapping of abstract data to graphic variables to make a visual representation
Static visualizations are those which do not move and cannot be manipulated; dynamic visualizations are short animations which show change, either over time or across some other variable; interactive visualizations allow the user to manipulate the graphical variables themselves in real-time. [...] The key is striking a balance between clarity and flexibility.

maps--cartography is as much of an art as it is a science

## static site
- used other site-building platforms before, but have never made a static site using github
- easier than I expected
- https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
- [customize the theme layout](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.14/user/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme)
