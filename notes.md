# Week Five Notes

## Mapping
- didn't have any location-based research in mind at first, so I just mapped a theoretical road trip I would have from my hometown to Ottawa

- map is in the style of the maps from the time period
- shows the movement of the battles, who was attacking from where, how they had to transport troops/resources

## Posters
- academic posters and infographics
- information visualization: mapping of abstract data to graphic variables to make a visual representation
Static visualizations are those which do not move and cannot be manipulated; dynamic visualizations are short animations which show change, either over time or across some other variable; interactive visualizations allow the user to manipulate the graphical variables themselves in real-time. [...] The key is striking a balance between clarity and flexibility.

maps--cartography is as much of an art as it is a science

## static site
- used other site-building platforms before, but have never made a static site using github
- easier than I expected
- https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site
